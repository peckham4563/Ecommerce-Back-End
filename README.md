# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description
This challenge was to build a back end for an e-commerce website given some starter code. With this starter code we were given a working Express.js API and it was configured to interact with MySQL using Sequelize. I created different models and seeds and used Insomnia as well with the creation of this repository.
